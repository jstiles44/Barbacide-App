# Project Overview

## Barbacide App

## Project Description

This app will be a useful tool for a band.  It will allow the user to choose a song and have the lyrics of the song displayed.  The lyrics will display in such a way that the user can read all of them at once.  This will be ideal for singing while also playing and instrument. The app will also allow the user to add new songs to the site for selection.

## API and Data Sample

JSON returned by Airtable:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "recrqfWpQ3j9l1qyy",
            "fields": {
                "title": "Young Lust",
                "artist": "Pink Floyd",

}
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Once a user selects a song from the song list, the lyrics of that song will be displayed
- User can input a song with lyrics to the list 
- Nav bar will link back to homepage from anywhere on site 

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add Form to link to 3rd party video file to site
- Add Form to link to 3rd party music file to site

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Feb 15-16| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|Feb 16| Project Approval | Incomplete
|Feb 16-17| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Feb 16-18| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Feb 17-18| MVP | Incomplete


## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I have a good idea for what I want my site to do.  I know what labs and exercises show similar situations to my site, and I will use them as references when working through the site. 

### Weaknesses:
I feel like I am stronger user functional components than class components.  If time permits I would like to add at least one class component to my project for practice. 

### Opportunities:
This is an opportunity to cement concepts learned over the first five weeks of the course.  This app will also serve as a very useful tool for my band. 

### Threats:
I tend to try to solve problems by myself even if others can lead me to an answer faster.  I will focus on knowing when to ask for help and managing my time efficiently
